graphic design (skills): windows, colors, events, fill shapes, ...
-Ray-casting
----------------
parsing :
    -Your program must be able to set the floor and ceiling colors
         to two different ones.
Need :
	-Colors existing + Texture (NO-SO-WE-EA)
	-map closed with '1'

N = fo9
S = ta7t
C      51,198,227       (couleur samawi)
F       184,113,39   (couleur de la terre)
NO Mandatory/text/mona.xpm
SO Mandatory/text/perle.xpm
WE Mandatory/text/van-Gogh.xpm    
EA Mandatory/text/zlij.xpm
----------------------------------
*EXECUTION:
    -The W, A, S, and D keys must allow you to move the point of view through
        the maze.
    -The left and right arrow keys of the keyboard must allow you to look left and
        right in the maze
    -Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly
    -Clicking on the red cross on the window’s frame must close the window and
        quit the program cleanly.
    -The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.

-----------------------------------------
*PARSING:
    -Your program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the ".cub"
        extension.
    -The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: 0 for an empty space,
        1 for a wall, and N,S,E or W for the player’s start position and spawning
            orientation.
    -The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return
        an error.
    -Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
        more empty line(s).
    -Except for the map content which always has to be the last, each type of
        element can be set in any order in the file.
    -◦ Except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated
        by one or more space(s).
